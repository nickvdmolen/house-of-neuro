# House of Neuro

This project uses a `.env` file for configuration. The committed `.env` contains placeholder values only.

Replace these placeholders with your real credentials before deploying. Never commit production secrets to the repositoryâ€”configure them directly in the deployment environment to keep sensitive data out of public git history.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the frontend used when generating password reset links. When the app is served from localhost this value is used; otherwise the current origin is used. |
| `REACT_APP_API_BASE` | Base URL of the API server used to send reset emails. When running on localhost this value can point to a different server (e.g. `http://localhost:3001`); in production the current origin is used automatically. |
